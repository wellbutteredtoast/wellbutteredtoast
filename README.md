I am Sam, a full time student of the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://mun.ca), majoring in the field of Computer Science, minoring in Statistics. I currently do not work in the field of tech, however I am growing my network in the local community. I like cats, and nice to read code (for the most part).

# Primary Development Languages

## [Python](https://www.python.org/)

My most proficient programming language by years of experience is Python. I started learning Python in my spare time during the lockdowns of 2020. I use it primarily for small projects and LeetCode problems, and occasional game development prototypes in [pygame-ce](https://pyga.me). Python is also the language I primarily use on campus. 

For me; Python is a productive language because of how quickly I can spin up a solution without needing to worry to much about static types or a rigid syntax like C++, Rust, among others. It's also fairly fast for an interpreted language, providing rather rapid solutions for most of my day to day issues or problems.

## [Go](https://go.dev)

Go is an interesting language, it's got the "you're in control" feeling of C and C++ but with the batteries-included power of many other languages. Go just works for me, its concurrency has been a game-changer in some of my yet-to-be-published projects. Alongisde Rust and some other newer lower level language, I can see Go being hailed in the future as one of **the** languages to know and master to work in tech.

## [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) / [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

I will say it, I do not like working with Java. I find its syntax verbose and agonizing, I'll continue to use it considering some big tools are reliant on it. Kotlin is better in terms of syntax, most of the time. At the end of the day these langauges are both fine, productive languages, but I've personally found Java to be a headache and Kotlin to be a slight breath of fresh air when using the JVM.

<!-- ## C++

C++ is a powerful language, and it was quite the step up from Python when I started learning C++. I'm learning C++ because of its use in all parts of software development, from applications to game engines to low level systems like the Windows Kernel and many embedded devices and IoT systems around the world. I also tinker with graphics and game development in C++, but as of the time of writing of this I don't have anything that is worth sharing (yet). -->

## [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Rust is the newest language in my repetoire. Being a bit more dense than C++, and having a more pedantic compilation system. Rust is insanely fast, and extremely powerful. I believe that when it comes to level and secure systems, Rust is the future in my opinion. I will continue to use both C++ *and* Rust for the forseeable future.

## [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)

Bash is a really helpful language for working in a UNIX environment, such as a Linux server, or my Mac that I carry with me. Bash is quirky, and helpful when doing shell shenanigans. I wouldn't exactly use it for anything *big*, but small utilities that are quickly pulled together is what I use it for most, also Python [(venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) environments, which are really helpful.
