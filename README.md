I am Sam, a full time student of the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://mun.ca), majoring in the Education at a Post-Secondary level. I currently do not work in the field of tech, however I am growing my network in the local community. I like cats, and nice to read code (for the most part). I plan on teaching Computer Science courses after my program is finished. This Github repository is my personal archive and storage. Mostly personal projects will be dropped here, and my own forks of FOSS tools that I either modify for myself or plan on contributing to!
