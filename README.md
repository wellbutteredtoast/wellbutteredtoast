# Hey there 🎉

Hi, I'm Sam Watson. I'm currently studying Post-Secondary Education at Memorial University while serving as VP of the [MUN Computer Science Society](https://muncompsci.ca) (MUNCSS), where I'm helping to build a social community around the field of Computer Science.

## What I'm working with

I build things in **Python** and **C++**, and I'm expanding into **Java** and **C#** because the best way to learn is to actually make something. Whether it's automating tasks, solving novel problems, or exploring new systems, I'm most interested in projects where code meets real-world impact.

I'll occasionally use other languages like **Lua** or **Ruby** but for the most part I'm consistently using Python or C++.

## Why I'm here

I'm looking to contribute to open-source projects that:
- Make technology more accessible and easier to learn
- Solve practical problems for everyone

If you're working on something in Python, C++, Java, or C# and need an extra pair of hands, I'd love to hear about it. Just email me, my address is on my profile!
