Hello, I am me! I do things sometimes, I'm in university, which is cool. I like languages with elegant syntax such as Python and Ruby, but I am decently versed in other languages such as Bash for my Linux/Mac devices, Powershell for Windows scripting, C# which I dabble with outside of classes, and modern languages built for safety and systems development like Rust and Zig.

I'm majoring in Computer Science, concentrating in Data Centric Science and a minors in Probability in Statistics at [MUN](https://www.mun.ca/computerscience/). There are also other languages I occastionally have to be subjected to like Java. Ah well, such is life. This is a mix of personal and educational projects as I go through my primary degree, and then my future in potential graduate studies and my secondary degree in Education.

I'm also a member of the [MUN Computer Science Society](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety) -- however I am not *very active* within the community.
